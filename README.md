Fix a broken version of a responsive website
In this project you will fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic.<br>
You will be provided specs to help guide you in making adjustments to the broken code.<br>
As you fix Fotomatic’s bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the Chrome DevTools article to help you decipher and update the site’s CSS.<br>
Chrome DevTools are essential for debugging – they allow you to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different rule values.<br>
